TensorFlow provides a platform for implementing and execute machine learning 
algorithms and is highly popular with deep neural network models and 
algorithms. TensorFlow is cross-platform, it can support mobile and embedded 
platforms. It has lot of API to support complex computations and algorithms.
The famous computation in on the numeric data and generate the data flow 
graphs. TensorFlow has many powerful APIs which provides the ease with 
implementation of any model across any platforms, it can be implemented on 
a server, mobile or desktop with ease and less configuration due to these 
powerful APIs. Google Brain team developed TensorFlow and gave a new way 
for researches using machine learning and deep learning algorithms
~\cite{hid-sp18-520-TensorFlow}.
Model built using TensorFlow, can have lot of computations and steps before 
it produces the respective output for classification or prediction or any 
results for Deep learning algorithms and can be tedious to follow all the 
steps and calculations. TensorFlow provides an a visualization of all these 
calculation and steps using a tool named TensorBoard. It can be used for 
visualizing graphs, or can be used for plotting data in the graph
~\cite{hid-sp18-520-TensorFlowboard}.
