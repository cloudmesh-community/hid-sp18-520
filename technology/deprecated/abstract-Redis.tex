Redis is No SQL database, supports Key value databases by mapping its key 
to type of values. It is a open source, and can support all kind of data 
structures similar to other databases including list, strings, ranges, 
bitmaps and many others. It can also support range and radius queries 
which are handling the one dimensional or multidimensional values for 
computation. Redis is provided with in built scripting and programming 
language. Feature of using the in-memory helps Redis to provide a high 
performance and faster~\cite{hid-sp18-520-Redis}.
There is a mechanism for clearing the cache data once reached its max 
capacity defined during the configuration. It identifies the policies 
based on the different combination of trends and can be appropriately 
be removed~\cite{hid-sp18-520-RedisModulescac}.
Redis has the feature named Redis replication which is very useful in case of 
connectivity issues between master and slaves servers, it provided the 
potential for making slaves as replica of master, in cases of any connectivity 
issues between master and slave servers or master server is not operational
~\cite{hid-sp18-520-RedisModules}.
