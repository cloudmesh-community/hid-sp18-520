OrientDB is NoSQL database, which supports the graph engines and it can be 
implemented as document database or as a Object-Oriented database
~\cite{hid-sp18-520-OrientDB}.
With Document database, it stores the documents as Key and value pairs. 
It refers group of these documents as collections. In OrientDB, classes or 
clusters are same as Tables and every documents is same as rows in 
relational models. With Graph databases, it creates the nodes known 
as Vertex and arcs known as Edges for storing the data. Vertex are same 
as rows in relational database. Vertex and Edges properties are same 
as the columns in relational database. It supports SQL as the built 
in query language. It is adhering to the ACID properties for database 
management systems. OrientDB offers indexing feature for high performance 
with 3 different type of algorithms~\cite{hid-sp18-520-OrientDBconcepts}.
Graph databases are useful for developing application related to social 
networking and establish relationships between objects with respect to 
there properties. It maintains class relation using documents and links 
in document model~\cite{hid-sp18-520-OrientDB-graph}.
