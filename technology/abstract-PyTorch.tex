PyTorch is known as Python based scientific computation package, built to 
support deep learning researches and neural network models.
PyTorch has many packages and are used for deep learning, multi processing,
loading data. It is fast and has high computation speed when run with any 
size of datasets~\cite{hid-sp18-520-PyTorch}.
PyTorch uses Tensors for building computation and are very similar to 
Numpy arrays.It uses the GPUs for its computation and responsible for faster 
retrieval of the data or results which are required for neural network.
 There are many variable provided by PyTorch which detail on Tensor and 
its gradient. It provides provision for computational graphs which helps 
alot during the debugging of the code or viewing any results from any 
computations step by step~\cite{hid-sp18-520-PyTorchgrad}.
There are many modules defined with PyTorch, some of them are like 
nn Module, which is acting as neural network layers producing outputs 
with weights details. Autograd module, which captures and helps calculating 
derivatives and gradients. With Optim module, which are very helpful when
implementing the optimized model for neural network models creation
~\cite{hid-sp18-520-PyTorchtensor}.
