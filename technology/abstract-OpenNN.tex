\index{OpenNN}

OpenNN is a collection of function developed for research work in field of 
Deep learning and deployment of neural network. This is available as open 
source library. As the development of this library is in C++ programming 
language, which give it a benefit of low memory usage and provides high 
performance with less computation time. For better computation, CPU 
parallelism can be configured. This is utilized in the field of predictive 
modeling and data mining and can be embedded as an API with analytical tool.
 Neural Designer is a analytical tool which has OpenNN library and provides a 
UI interface for users. This provide the ease for the users to do any data 
entry tasks or once the model is created and output is generated, can provide 
results interpretation~\cite{hid-sp18-520-OpenNN}.
There is multilayer perceptron concept is built with implementation of 
neural network in OpenNN, this can support and contain layers which 
are for ``scaling, unscaling, bounding, probabilistic and conditions layers''
~\cite{hid-sp18-520-OpenNNn}.
